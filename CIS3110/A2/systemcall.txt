Overall, what I noticed is that C library functions tend to be quicker for reading files.
I expected that going into this assignment because I/O systems calls seem to not be used
that much any more. I noticed that in all cases when reading one byte at a time, the
system I/O calls was anywhere from 10-50 times slower. Once the read size increases
though, is becomes not as noticable.

I made 2 different a2output files. a2output.txt includes the results for reading a file
that was 1 megabyte in size. a2output1.txt includes results from a file that was 10
megabytes in size. On my computer, the differences were not that noticable for the file
size 1M.
